# Chess
Fully functional representation of the chess game - in pure Java with GUI

GUI is split into the board part when users can move pieces only correctly, using mouse in their turn and movesPanel part when all the moves are displayed.

Includes functionality that allows you to undo a move with the right button, perform a castle, promote your Pawn, move a pawn two squares from starting position, make all possible moves conditional by pieces logic. All possible moves are displayed after clicking on piece with grey color, also possible captures are represented with red color. Othres special moves like promotion pawn also have their representation with color.

Program monitor the state of the game, and if the game is over, the user will be informed.
Object-oriented programming with encapsulation, and spliting logic from gui.
